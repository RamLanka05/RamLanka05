# Hi there! I'm Sathvik 👋

I am a third-year student at the **University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign**, pursuing a **B.S. in Computer Science and Statistics** with a minor in **Mathematics**.

I love building things that live at the intersection of complex data and interactive experiences. Currently, I'm diving deep into lower-level systems while expanding my expertise in ML and VR development.

### 🔭 Focus Areas

* **Systems Programming:** Exploring the low-level optimizations and architecture that power software using **C** and **C++**.
*  **Full Stack Development:** Building scalable web applications with the **MERN** stack and **Python Flask**.
* **Machine Learning:** Leveraging my statistics background to build predictive models and analysis tools using `Pandas`, `NumPy`, and `SciPy`.
* **Game Development & VR:** Creating immersive simulations in **Unity** (C#) and exploring **Unreal Engine**.
